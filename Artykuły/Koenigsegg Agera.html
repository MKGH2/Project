            The Koenigsegg Agera is a mid-engine sports car produced by Swedish
            car manufacturer Koenigsegg. <br />
            It is a successor to the CCX/CCXR. <br />
            The name comes from the Swedish verb 'agera' which means "to act" or
            in imperative form "(You) act!". <br />
            It was named Hypercar of the Year in 2010 by Top Gear magazine.

            The Agera RS variant became the world's fastest production car in
            2017, setting a record with a GPS-verified two-way average top speed
