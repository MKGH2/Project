          <h3>
            The Koenigsegg Regera is a limited production, plug-in hybrid grand
            touring sports car manufactured by Swedish automotive manufacturer
            Koenigsegg. <br />
            It was unveiled at the March 2015 Geneva Motor Show. <br />
            The name Regera is a Swedish verb, meaning "to reign" or "to rule".
            <br />
            Koenigsegg produced only 80 units of the car, most of which were
            sold upon unveiling. <br />
            The Regera was developed and designed to be a more practical,
            luxurious, grand touring alternative to the rest of Koenigsegg's
            lightweight sports car lineup; initially the Agera and currently the
            Jesko. <br />
            As a result, it is less focused on-track performance and spartan
            weight reduction and more focused on the smooth and instant delivery
            of power provided by its overhauled powertrain. <br />
            Koenigsegg states that the Regera will be one of the most powerful
            and fastest-accelerating hybrid production cars produced. <br />
            The introduction of the Regera alongside the Agera RS in 2015
            resulted in Koenigsegg, for the first time ever, simultaneously
            having two models in production. <br />
            This role was passed from the Agera to the Jesko in 2019, which
            briefly shared the production line with the Regera when Jesko
            production began in late 2021.
