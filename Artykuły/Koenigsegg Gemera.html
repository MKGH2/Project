          <h3>
            The Gemera is the first four-seater hypercar in the world and also
            the first four-seater car built by Koenigsegg and the first to be
            powered by a compact engine weighing only 70 kg (150 lb). <br />
            The engine is so small because it is a camless piston engine, the
            first such engine announced for a production car. <br />
            Called the Tiny Friendly Giant (TFG), the three-cylinder engine
            displaces 1988.25 cc, has two turbos and drives the front wheels
            while also charging the batteries. <br />
            It is rated at 440 kW (598 PS; 590 hp) at 7500 rpm, with a redline
            at 8500 rpm, and 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque from 2000 to 7000
            rpm. <br />
            There are also three electric motors, one for each rear wheel with
            373 kW (507 PS; 500 hp) and 1000 Nm each and one on the crankshaft
            with 298 kW (406 PS; 400 hp) and 500 Nm to power the front wheels;
            these combine to give 820 kW (1,100 PS; 1,100 hp) of electric power;
            together with the engine this gives a combined peak output of 1,268
            kW (1,700 hp; 1,724 PS) and 3,500 N⋅m (2,581 lb⋅ft) of torque
            (maximum torque 11,000 N⋅m (8,113 lb⋅ft) at 4000 rpm) These outputs
            are produced when the engine runs on E85 fuel, but it can run on any
            major fuel from E100 to standard gasoline. <br />
            The engine also features cylinder deactivation and claims to be 20
            percent more fuel efficient than a typical four-cylinder engine of
            the same displacement. <br />
            The range on the 54 MJ (15 kWh) battery pack is claimed to be 50 km
            (31 mi) and while in hybrid mode the range extends to 1,000 km (621
            mi). <br />
            On 7 July 2023 at the inauguration of the expanded factory in
            Angelholm, Sweden, company founder Christian von Koenigsegg
            announced details for the production Gemera. <br />
            A new single electric motor known as Dark Matter replaces the
            previous triple electric motor setup, and produces 597 kW (811 PS;
            800 hp) and 1250 Nm. <br />
            The three-cylinder powertrain has a combined power output of 1,044
            kW (1,400 hp; 1,419 PS) and 1,849 N⋅m (1,364 lb⋅ft) of torque.
            <br />
            The 5.0-litre twin-turbo V8 from the Jesko will also be offered as a
            $400,000 option. <br />
            The V8 powertrain has a combined power output of 1,700 kW (2,300 hp;
            2,300 PS) and 2,750 N⋅m (2,028 lb⋅ft) of torque when the engine runs
            on E85 fuel. <br />
            Both engines are mated to the 9-speed Light Speed Transmission found
            in the Jesko.
