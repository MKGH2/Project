          <h1>What is Koenigsegg Jesko??</h1>
          <p>
            <b>
              The Koenigsegg Jesko is a limited production mid-engine sports car
              produced by Swedish automobile manufacturer Koenigsegg. The car
              was introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show and it completely
              sold out before the show ended. The car succeeds the Agera. The
              name Jesko is a tribute to the company founder's father, Jesko von
              Koenigsegg. There are two variations of the car - "Absolut" (top
              speed) and "Attack" (track-focused).

          <h3>
            Production of the Jesko will be limited to 125 units, with 40-50
            units being produced each year. <br />
            Unlike its predecessors, the Jesko will be homologated worldwide.
            <br />
            It was announced in March 2019 that all the build slots of the Jesko
            were sold out. <br />
            The Jesko will be offered in either a high-downforce Attack or
            low-drag Absolut configuration, with subtle differences between the
            two variants. <br />
            The Attack variant, as shown at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, comes
            equipped with the dual front and rear 'Triplex' damper system and
            added aerodynamic features for track use. <br />
            Due to this dual suspension setup, it is not possible to store the
            Targa roof in the front of the car, although this is possible in the
            Absolut as it will not have a front 'Triplex' damper system or front
            hood air dam. <br />
            In July 2021, Koenigsegg revealed the first pre-series production
            Jesko and claimed that the first Jesko customer cars are slated for
            delivery in spring 2022. <br />
            As of November 2022, no customer cars had been delivered.
